Recently at our TMR Ocala 6th street location we were having trouble with a slow system in the scale house. It turned out to be a switch that had 500ms response times. We rebooted the switch and the pings returned to a normal 30ms. In this process, cameras in the scale house went down and cannot be accessed form insight neo. There is an uplink from this switch to what appears to be an eyewitness server. We also rebooted the server to see if there was any change, however there was not.

Camera 108 is no longer a thermal camera and it is no longer in the position that it's displayed in on our maps.  If someone has some sort of insight as to where this camera is now positioned, I really need that information back so that I can update our map and we can properly secure this area.  Right now, if there were to be an intruder seen on this camera during monitoring hours, we would have no idea where to direct the police to.  Additionally, the name of the camera needs to be updated, since it is still displaying that it's a thermal camera.

Hello,

We had a tech on site last week regarding to camera 103 being offline. He found that Djj has a bad switch that is connecting to our switch that is controlling those cameras, Djj is working on getting their switch back up and that will bring the camera 103 back online. At this time, camera 103 remains offline. We are moving this case into the account management cue, please follow up with the site manager in regards to replacing their faulty switch. - SR

Good morning,

We have some new cameras on site at UPAP Fort Meyers that have been installed. These are cameras that used to be at TMR Fort Meyers but had to be moved over to UPAP as we are separating the companies at the end of the year.

Do you see any cameras with an IP of 192.168.117.x on the UPAP Fort Meyers network? If so, can these be reip'd to work on this network (192.168.209.x) and be brought into the UPAP Fort Meyers VMS? These will all be non-monitored cameras.

The modem has a light for ""power"" and ""online"" lit up, but there are two other lights that arent lit up, we arent able to tell what those lights are for because the text for them is only visible when the light is on. Site was not sure if we are sharing a connection, however the site seems to not be experiencing network problems. We went ahead and rebooted the modem, this did not bring any new lights up.

Hi Chas,
 
When we replaced the server, we discovered that the storage drives were also shot and need to be replaced. We should be getting new drives out asap to you so we can get the server back up and running. We can monitor you currently, so your yard is protected. I will follow up internally to see where the drive order stands and we will update you asap.

There was a lighting strike last night that knocked out a total of 13 cameras last night. I am on the way to the site now to start troubleshooting. There are 4 100 series cameras out and the rest are 200 series.
Could I get a tech dispatched to assist with the 100 series cameras and troubleshooting of the 200 series?
It would seem one of the switches also has died, I rebooted both switches to see if it brought some cameras back up but instead, one of the switches doesn�t seem like it is coming back online. Here is a picture of it. No link lights.
When it comes on, a green light shows on system for a short time. Then goes away.

Hello Mr. Ron,

We had our techs Keith and Jeremy on site in regards to the offline cameras from the lightening strike. They were able to replace switches and fix the majority of the cameras aside from 103,211,233,234,246,247. All cameras need to be replaced and 3 of them require new cable runs. Jeremy mentioned he was told that DJJ was ordering the replacement cameras for all including 103.

I wanted to follow up about this.

Hello,

Camera 232 is offline here along with Camera 110 and located on the same pole.

Keith was told that parts fell a scale and cut the wires. We need to run new cable for Camera 110, would you like us to go ahead run cable for 232 as well?

Also we suggest running these though a metal pipe so this does not happen again.

Respectfully,

Subject: RE: Immix Question - RMR Newport 

Only by turning them off which I won�t do.  Other than that, they have to be processed.


Good Evening all,

I was trying to find out if there is a way to stop the Ecare fails from coming through to the TOC after the site disarms for the day. This site, RMR Newport, disarms at 4:30 am and Immix does execute the disarm but Ecare fail alarms are seen coming through to the Operators in the TOC and they are being forced to process alarms/events that should not be coming through. The Ecare fails are noticed still coming through to the event until 9:05. This is making 5 more hours of processing for this site that the TOC should not have to deal with.

Is there a way to have the alarms stop reporting to the event after the site disarms? Im trying to find out if there is some way to make this better because right now, we are forced to watch them until 9.

If you come up with any ideas that I can help with, please let me know.

Could I get a tech dispatched to assist with the 100 series cameras and troubleshooting of the 200 series?
It would seem one of the switches also has died, I rebooted both switches to see if it brought some cameras back up but instead, one of the switches doesn�t seem like it is coming back online. Here is a picture of it. No link lights.
When it comes on, a green light shows on system for a short time. Then goes away.

Brittany,

Josh and I were just on another call W/Hackett and the contractor doing the cabling for the Nucor access control install.  DJJ is very concerned with hardware availability, and Mike wants to buy upfront and parts that could have an availability issue.

Beyond the readers which have been ordered, Josh feels the panels and power supply are a concern.  Mike is looking for a quote so he can cut a check to simply buy the equipment now to ensure it will be in hand to start work at the end or August.

Thanks, hit me up with anything I need to do to make that happen.  BOM below

",Field Service,N/A,Closed,P1 - Standard Priority Issue,Yes,"hese cameras seem to be fine, the main issue appears to be the hardware they go through for networking.  I've had eyewitness and an electrician come out to check the networking and power.  Seems our components may be bad or are getting too hot in the box outside.  That said, Roger's guy faced 209 the wrong way when he came out last time and it won't remotely move.

Had a power outage because of a lightning strike at the RMR Seymour location (960 S County Rd 900 West
North Vernon, IN 47265)

We were able to get the yard server and VM back up, however, the users are still unable to connect to the eyewitness cameras. We have verified power on facetime to the eyewitness box. I only have the internal IP address of 192.168.113.41 . Can someone confirm this IP for the internal as well as provide the external IP for this location?

The supervisor at the yard told me he had talked to eyewitness support and said you all were able to ping the server. I just wanted to verify the IP of the server and see if you could help Josh with troubleshooting the connectivity issues after a power outage.

Josh's number is 502-643-0871 if you need to get into contact.

Thanks,

Tyler Hall - 12:39 PM 5/18/2022 - I moved this from the Case Description: I have received a ticket from a teammate at our TMR Gainesville, Florida location regarding their eyewitness cameras on site. They stated their cameras say they have timed out. I took the external IP I have for this location, 98.190.216.48 , and tried to ping the server, however, the ping timed out. I also tried to connect to the location through Insight Neo, which also failed. I am unsure if this server has gone down or if the IP has changed causing this loss of connection. Could someone please investigate this location's Eyewitness server? Again this is Trademark Metals Recycling in Gainesville, Florida.

We are in a process of investigating the issue and hope to have a resolution soon. 
If you are having intercom issue, here is the temporary solution:
To manually use your intercom, please record the announcement on your phone. Save the audio. Hook up your phone on to the barix device manually. And play your phone with the announcement. 
Currently, UPAP Aurora is using the manual audio 
Please let me know if you have any questions

I dropped the ball on this one. Originally this was a TL install job, when I inherited this project the panic buttons had been installed but not activated in Rapid Web/Monitoring. During my trip to Houston for another project, I stopped by and tested these buttons and one of them was not working. I told the customer I would get another one ordered and send someone out to replace it. Obviously that part has been missed. 

Fast forward to today. 

I have a panic button I can overnight to a tech in Houston to get this replaced. @Brittany Roy can you please let me know what address I need to send this button to? Its wireless and shouldn�t take more then 1 hour for a tech to install it. If Rey has availability this week, he can call me when he arrives onsite, and I will walk him thru replacement and testing.",Field Service,N/A,Closed,P1 - Standard Priority Issue,Yes,,CS00051218,broy,System Generated,9050 - SERVICE - FIELD,SW2,Break/Fix Service,10000007493-U-Pull-&-Pay Houston Port,,,Service,a518376ff6adcfe600ba2330cc5b27cb,10/31/2022,No,broy,4/14/2022,rfonseca,4/12/2022,Incomplete

Hello Mr. Josh,

Cameras 122 -125 are now back online. I know your electrician went to the site yesterday. I am not sure if he has any notes or updates as to what he found on this pole? Did he fix the power issue? Etc.  Our subcontractor left and didn�t get to meet with the electrician yesterday as he stated that once the electrician restores power to the pole, the cameras will be restored as well. 

I just want to make sure that these cameras stays stable

The piece of eyewitness equipment in the attached pictures is making a �clicking� noise as if it�s turning on and off. When it clicks, the system past this point loses power, clicks again and the power comes back

email from Steve D
It sounds like they are passing the blame. When the barix loses power the speaker will click and when power is restored the same thing. If they wanted to troubleshoot they would just remove power from the barix and see if the rest of the devices continue to lose power. I find it highly unlikely that this unit is causing anything else to lose power, even if there is a short in the device.

The truckscale cameras at TMR Ocala Shredder are all offline. This is affecting our legal compliance. Could you verify how you get your connection to the eyewitness switch at the truckscale building here? Does this come into a DJJ switch via copper or are you using your own wireless or fiber to get back to the main building?

Eyewitness switch looks like it has power but we can't see any cameras off of that switch. I'm trying to troubleshoot remotely so the more info the better. Thanks

Subject: Ocala Shredder - Cameras need changed

Good afternoon. At TMR Ocala Shredder there are two cameras that were installed on the shredder that were not mounted high enough (119 and 120). Original instructions were to install on the top of shredder tower but these were installed very low and do not provide us the views that we need. In picture below the red circles are where the cameras were installed  but they were requested to be installed within the red square. Can you please have a tech come on site and resolve this mistake? We have a lift on site that they can utilize if coordinated with facility management (Kevin Dunn)
